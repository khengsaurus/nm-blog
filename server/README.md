### Running services with Docker

Requirements: [LS CLI](https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local), Docker Compose, Python 3

```bash
# Run services in docker:
> docker compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up

# Init LocalStack S3:
> python3 scripts/ls_s3_setup.py

# List LocalStack S3 buckets
> awslocal s3 ls

# List contents of LocalStack S3 bucket
> awslocal s3 ls <bucket-name>

# Show tags of LocalStack S3 object
> awslocal s3api get-object-tagging --bucket <bucket-name> --key <object-key>
```

<hr/>

### Issues

- Adding header `x-amz-tagging` works in LS but results in 403 for AWS

- [Localstack docs](https://docs.localstack.cloud/localstack/persistence-mechanism/): "_...please note that persistence in LocalStack, as currently intended, is a Pro only feature..._" ðŸ˜•
